title: Understanding Linux Random Number Generator
date: 2019-04-04
description: The Linux random number generator (LRNG) produces random data for many security related applications and protocols. The generator is part of the Linux kernel open source project which has different versions since the original one. The survey describes the generator of Linux kernel version 2.6.30.7. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of all functions in LRNG as well as a security analysis against cryptographic attacks.
