title: Is JWT token really secure?
date: 2019-10-06
description: If you are familiar with OAuth 2.0, you probaly have heard of json web token many times (jwt token). In general, the access token in OAuth 2.0 protocol can have different formats and be protected by different crypotographic primitives. In this blog post, we will only discuss the jwt token in depth. JWT token is popular because it is powerful and authenticated. You can specify any assertions when creating the token to make it more expressive. The token is signed by the issuer (mostly not encrpted) so that no one can forge an token if he or she does not have the secret key. Sounds so far so good right? Until recently, I read some interesting attacks on the JWT token. So I decide to write a blog post about it. It is particulaly important to be aware of these attacks so that you can choose a secure implementatiion of jwt token library or if you want to implement secure jwt token from scratch. Let's dive in!
