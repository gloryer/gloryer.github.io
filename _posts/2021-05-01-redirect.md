title: Implementation and Design of Modbus over QUIC Protocol for ICS Networks
date: 2021-05-01
description: We designed and implemented a full-blown Modbus protocol running over QUIC. QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides lower-latency connection establishment than TCP/TLS. Our implementation is based on pymodbus and aioquic. We evaluated the connection latency for QUIC and TCP/TLS on a mininet virtual network, where we can easily change the network conditions (delay, percentages of packet loss).
