title: An Analysis of the Recent Ransomware Families
date: 2021-05-06
description: The notorious crypto-ransomware infections in the past, such as CryptoLocker and WannaCry, can immediately disrupt the access to files or systems after ransomware deployment. With no backups of the compromised systems, the victim has no choice but to pay the ransom and hope the attackers will restore the systems. Additionally, the threat actors pressure victims to pay the ransom demand by stealing the data and threatening to release the stolen data publicly. In the last year, ransomware is still the major malware threat, with 60% of managed service providers seeing attacks in the first half of 2020. The ransomware industry has continued to evolve with more sophisticated new ransomware families and more effective threat actors. We investigate the three most active ransomware families reported by Groupâ€“IB in 2020 (Maze, REvil and Ryuk). They stand out to other ransomware families with massive impact by leveraging sophisticated techniques. It is important to recognize the extensive analysis that has been done on these ransomware families by the security companies. Although each ransomware has different source codes, they show some common behaviors when they strike. We summary the behavioral patterns of the chosen ransomware families and present the characteristics of each ransomware family.
