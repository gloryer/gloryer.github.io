<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->



I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at `Purdue University`, advised by Prof. Elisa Bertino. My current research focuses on transfer learning and domain adaptation for security, particularly in defending against evolving cyber threats. I am exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential misuse in malware generation. My previous internships at `Cisco Research` and `Aviatrix` involved developing machine learning-based malware and malicious network traffic detectors. My prior research experience includes developing secure distributed authorization systems for smart homes.

I obtained my MSc in Computer Science from the `University of Calgary`, Canada, supervised by Prof. Reihaneh Safavi-Naini, and my Bachelor's degree from `Wuhan University`, China.
