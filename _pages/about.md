<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a computer science Ph.D. student at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) under the advisory of Prof. Elisa Bertino, focusing on cybersecurity and machine learning. My current research delves into general zero-shot learning and domain adaptation, collaborating with `IBM`. I'm also exploring GenAI methodologies for malware generation. I spent the summer 2023 at `Cisco Research`, where I applied graph neural networks to predict malware binaries using control flow graphs. Previously, during the summer of 2022, I worked at `Aviatrix`, employing machine learning techniques for traffic analysis.

Prior to Purdue, I was a research assistant at UCalgary and Telus where I worked on designing distributed authorization systems that help domain experts explore and address complex authorization scenarios in DevOps and smart homes. I obtained my MSc degree in computer science from the University of Calgary under the advisory of Prof. Reihaneh Safavi-Naini.
